what is what? what is my first project i did in python. i wanted to do it because it was all i knew, probaly because im 11. so... yeah. 
it was suprisingly easy to make and there where alot of bugs. my experience so far was fairly good. 8/10 my fingers hurt a lot.

i was bored so i did this. WIP open alpha.

any ideas of addons would be greatly appreciated.
